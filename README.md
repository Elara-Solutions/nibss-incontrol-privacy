**Last updated:** 5 February 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how **NIBSS InControl** (“the App”, “we”, “us”) collects, uses, and protects information when you use the application.

NIBSS InControl is designed with a **security-first and data-minimization approach**. We collect and process only the data required to provide secure banking and mandate management functionality.

We may process the following information when you use the App:

* Account-related identifiers required to display and manage mandates
* Minimal profile information (such as name or status flags) required for routing and user experience
* Authentication inputs (PIN, biometrics), which are **never transmitted** and are used only locally on the device

---

### 1.2 Camera Access

The App may request access to the **device camera** for specific features such as:

* Secure scanning
* Verification flows
* In-app capture where explicitly initiated by the user

**Camera data is used only for the requested function.**

* Camera access is **user-initiated**
* Camera images are **not accessed in the background**
* Camera data is **not shared or sold**

* App integrity
* Device integrity

This information is used solely to:

## 3. Data Storage and Retention

* Session tokens are stored **in memory only** and are cleared when the session ends
* Privileged account data is **not persisted** on the device
* Minimal non-sensitive preferences may be stored locally to support app usability

Data is retained only for as long as necessary to provide the service or as required by applicable regulations.

## 4. Data Sharing

Data may be shared only:

All data transmission is performed using secure, encrypted channels.

## 5. Security

We implement strong technical and organizational safeguards, including:

These measures are designed to prevent unauthorized access, data exposure, or misuse.
